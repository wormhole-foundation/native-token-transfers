## Evm Ntt Implementation

> **Note:** These are low-level protocol classes. If you are trying to perform a transfer, use the higher-level Route abstractions such as [`NttExecutorRoute`](../../sdk/route/src/executor/executor.ts) instead.

# Building

Make sure the Evm contracts are build with `npm run build:deps` and the bindings are generated with `npm run generate`
