// * Transfer ownership

/// For safety reasons, transferring ownership is a 2-step process. The first step is to set the
/// new owner, and the second step is for the new owner to claim the ownership.
/// This is to prevent a situation where the ownership is transferred to an
/// address that is not able to claim the ownership (by mistake).
///
/// The transfer can be cancelled by the existing owner invoking the [`claim_ownership`]
/// instruction.
///
/// Alternatively, the ownership can be transferred in a single step by calling the
/// [`transfer_ownership_one_step_unchecked`] instruction. This can be dangerous because if the new owner
/// cannot actually sign transactions (due to setting the wrong address), the program will be
/// permanently locked. If the intention is to transfer ownership to a program using this instruction,
/// take extra care to ensure that the owner is a PDA, not the program address itself.
