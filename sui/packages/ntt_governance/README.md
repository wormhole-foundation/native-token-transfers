# NTT Governance for Sui

Wormhole governance contract that receives guardian-signed VAAs and executes
admin operations on NTT via the existing `AdminCap` interface. Deployed as a
separate package that stores the NTT `AdminCap` and `UpgradeCap`.

## Why one governance per NTT

On EVM, a single governance contract uses `call(callData)` to invoke arbitrary
functions on any governed contract — one governance instance governs many
contracts. On Solana, `invoke_signed()` provides similar capability via CPI.

Sui intentionally prohibits dynamic dispatch. Every cross-module call must be
resolved at compile time with explicit type parameters and module paths. Since
each NTT deployment is a separate package with its own `State<T>`, the
governance package must import a specific `ntt` package at compile time. There
is no way to write a generic governance contract that works with arbitrary NTT
deployments. Each NTT deployment requires its own governance package.

## VAA verification flow

Governance actions are authorised by Wormhole governance VAAs signed by the
guardian set. The Wormhole SDK handles the outer envelope:

```
Envelope (handled by governance_message):
  MODULE_NAME (32 bytes, left-padded) | ACTION (1 byte) | CHAIN_ID (2 bytes)

Payload (parsed by this module):
  GOVERNANCE_ID (32 bytes) | ACTION_DATA (variable)
```

The verification flow in `verify_and_consume`:

1. Extract the action byte from the raw VAA payload at offset 32
2. Create a `DecreeTicket` with our module name (`NttGovernance`) and action
3. Call `governance_message::verify_vaa` — checks guardian signatures, emitter
   chain, emitter contract, and module name
4. Call `governance_message::take_payload` — consumes the VAA digest into
   `ConsumedVAAs` for replay protection and returns the inner payload
5. Strip the 32-byte `GOVERNANCE_ID` prefix, asserting it matches this
   `GovernanceState` object's ID
6. Return a `GovernanceDecree` hot-potato with the action and remaining payload

## GovernanceDecree hot-potato

`GovernanceDecree` has no `drop` ability — it must be consumed by an
`execute_*` function in the same transaction. Each `execute_*` function
destructures the decree, asserts the action ID matches, and parses the
action-specific payload.

The alternative design — a single `execute` function that calls
`verify_and_dispatch` inline — would make payload parsing untestable without
constructing guardian-signed VAAs in tests. By separating verification from
dispatch, the `new_decree` test helper can construct decrees directly, letting
tests exercise all 11 payload parsers and their edge cases (truncation,
trailing bytes, type mismatches) without VAA infrastructure.

The hot-potato pattern preserves the same security guarantee: a decree
can only be created by `verify_and_consume` (in production) and must be
consumed in the same transaction.

## GovernanceState singleton

`GovernanceState` is created by `init()`, which runs exactly once at package
publish and creates a shared object with its own `ConsumedVAAs` set.

If the constructor were public, anyone could create additional
`GovernanceState` instances. Each instance would have its own independent
`ConsumedVAAs`, allowing the same VAA to be replayed against multiple
instances. The `init()`-only pattern ensures exactly one instance exists per
package deployment.

## Capability storage

Capabilities (`AdminCap`, `UpgradeCap`) are stored as dynamic object fields
rather than direct struct fields.

Direct struct fields would wrap the capabilities inside `GovernanceState`,
removing them from the top-level object store. This makes them invisible to
off-chain tools (explorers, indexers) and prevents `transfer::public_receive`
from working — they can't be transferred out without a custom extraction
function.

Dynamic object fields preserve each capability's identity as a top-level
object. This means:

- Off-chain tools can discover which caps a governance instance holds
- Capabilities can be extracted with `ofield::remove` and transferred via
  `transfer::public_transfer` for ownership handoff
- The standard `Receiving<T>` / `public_receive` pattern works for ingestion

## Deployment flow

```
1. sui client publish  →  init() creates shared GovernanceState
2. sui client transfer-object AdminCap     --to <GovernanceState address>
   sui client transfer-object UpgradeCap   --to <GovernanceState address>
3. PTB: governance::receive_admin_cap(gov, admin_receiving)
        governance::receive_upgrade_cap(gov, upgrade_receiving)
```

The `receive_admin_cap` / `receive_upgrade_cap` functions are permissionless —
anyone can call them. This is safe because the capability must already have
been transferred to the `GovernanceState`'s address; `public_receive` enforces
this. A governance instance without caps is inert: action handlers abort with
`EFieldDoesNotExist` from dynamic object field access until caps are received.

`receive_upgrade_cap` does not perform an explicit runtime package check. The
type system already guarantees correctness: `ntt::upgrades::UpgradeCap` is
bound to the specific NTT package at compile time, `public_receive` enforces
exact type matching (package ID is part of the type identity), and
`ntt::upgrades::new_upgrade_cap` validates the inner `sui::package::UpgradeCap`
via `assert_package_upgrade_cap` at creation time.

After receiving caps, all admin operations require a guardian-signed VAA.

## Ownership transfer (governance handoff)

To migrate from governance A to governance B (e.g., upgrading the governance
contract itself):

```
Tx 1: Publish new governance package → creates GovernanceState B
Tx 2: VAA → verify_and_consume(gov_a) → execute_transfer_ownership(gov_a, decree)
       (caps are transferred to gov_b's address)
Tx 3: governance_b::receive_admin_cap(gov_b, ...)
       governance_b::receive_upgrade_cap(gov_b, ...)
```

After tx 2, governance A is inert (no caps). After tx 3, governance B controls
the NTT deployment.

WARNING: `execute_transfer_ownership` sends caps to the raw address in the VAA
payload with no on-chain validation. An incorrect address permanently loses
admin control. Operators must verify the address in the governance proposal.

**Race condition (accepted):** If a capability is in-flight (transferred to
this governance's address but `receive_*` not yet called) when
`execute_transfer_ownership` fires, that in-flight cap becomes unreachable.
The governance transfers out what it has and the in-flight cap remains owned by
the old governance's address with no way to receive it. Operators must ensure
both caps are received before initiating ownership transfer.

## Upgrade flow

NTT package upgrades use a two-phase hot-potato pattern matching Wormhole's
own upgrade mechanism:

```
PTB:
  1. vaa::parse_and_verify(wh_state, vaa_bytes, clock)  →  VAA
  2. governance::verify_and_consume(gov, wh_state, vaa)  →  GovernanceDecree
  3. governance::execute_authorize_upgrade(gov, decree)   →  UpgradeTicket
  4. sui::package::upgrade(ticket, modules, deps, policy) →  UpgradeReceipt
  5. governance::execute_commit_upgrade<T>(gov, ntt_state, receipt)
```

Steps 3-5 must occur in a single PTB. The `UpgradeTicket` and
`UpgradeReceipt` are hot-potatoes that enforce this. `execute_commit_upgrade`
does not require a separate VAA — authorisation was established in step 3.

| 9   | DisableTransceiver  | `transceiver_id (u8)`                                                               |
| 10  | AuthorizeUpgrade    | `digest (32)`                                                                       |
| 11  | TransferOwnership   | `new_owner (32)`                                                                    |

All payloads are prefixed with the 32-byte `GOVERNANCE_ID` (the
`GovernanceState` object ID), which is stripped by `verify_and_consume` before
the action-specific data reaches `execute_*`.

## Security: governance package UpgradeCap

This package's own `sui::package::UpgradeCap` (created at publish) is NOT
stored or governed here. Whoever holds it can upgrade this module without
guardian approval — potentially modifying VAA verification, adding backdoors,
or extracting stored capabilities.

After deployment, operators MUST either:

1. Make the governance package immutable (`sui client upgrade --policy immutable`), or
2. Transfer its UpgradeCap to a trusted multisig or separate governance mechanism

Failure to secure the governance UpgradeCap undermines the entire trust model.
